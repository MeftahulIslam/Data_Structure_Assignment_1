Containers are loaded into the underground mine warehouse (one on top of another because the shaft is narrow), by defining its code, name and quantity of stored goods in it. The storage space can hold up to 12 containers. They are sorted by loading one by one by the name of stored goods.
If the same type of goods containers already is loaded the shaft, which is not at the top of the shaft (they are loaded with other containers), then the upper containers need to be unloaded, a new container should be loaded, and then returned to the containers that were unloaded.

The following should be possible:
1)	To load containers into the warehouse.
2)	Review the contents of the warehouse by printing the container code and the name of stored goods;
3)	To remove from the warehouse all containers with the specified quantity rule (for example less than 10), print to the display what was removed;
4)	Remove all containers from the warehouse, print what was removed.
5)	Count the number of items of a particular goods type.
